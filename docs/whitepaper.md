# Structura Whitepaper

## Introduction
Structura aims to fuse AI optimization with blockchain transparency in construction.

## Problem Statement
- Construction projects often face budget overruns, miscommunication, and supply chain delays.

## Proposed Solution
- **AI-Driven Analytics** for real-time budgeting and resource allocation.
- **Immutable Milestones** on Solana's blockchain for trustless verification.
- **Token Incentives** ($STURA) to align all stakeholders toward project success.

## Technical Details
- On-chain data structures and smart contracts handle milestone logic.
- Off-chain AI modules compute predictive analytics and feed them on-chain (via oracles or bridging solutions).

## Conclusion
Structura will streamline the construction industry with cutting-edge AI and decentralized accountability.
